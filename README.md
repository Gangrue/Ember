User instructions:

1. Click middle "Clocked Out" button to clock in/out.
2. Once clocked in you will stay clocked in until inactive/using blacklisted programs or sites. If this happens, it will go into "Sleep mode". Once you are active/close blacklisted programs or sites, the program will awaken and automatically clock you in.
3. If you want to modify the list of programs or sites. Click the Icon next to the "X". It's just a big text field. Comma delimited or enter delimited. Doesn't matter. It ignores whitespace which might be a problem.
4. Click save and it will update the black listed programs/sites.
5. Once you click "X" the program will clock you out and create a "DailyReport.txt" which will show the time you spent active day by day.
